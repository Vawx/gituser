## Rules
1. Manage frontend dependencies with Bower.
2. Manage all our other dependencies with npm.
3. Write an asset pipeline with a live reloading development server in gulp.

#### You must include gulp tasks for:

1. Concatenation, minification, and running the browserify package on your JavaScript.
2. Building and cleaning.
3. Running the development server with live reloading.
4. Running JSHint.
5. Compiling SASS.
6. Automatically including Bower dependencies as vendor.js and vendor.css.

##Objectives

#### Your code will be reviewed on the following criteria:

1. Does the website work as expected?
2. Do you manage your build tool dependencies with npm?
3. Do you manage your front-end dependencies with Bower?
4. Does the app include a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server? Does the asset pipeline include all tasks from the homework this week? (Listed above)
5. Is the app structured in a logical way, including some SASS and at least 2 JavaScript files?
6. Did you use exports in at least one of your JavaScript files?
7. Does the code stick to standards from previous weeks? (Testing is not required this week.)

####Final objective

1. Does it make an AJAX request and parse the JSON response, using the data correctly?
